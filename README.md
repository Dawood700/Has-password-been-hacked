# Has-password-been-hacked
This program uses the "Have I Been Pwned" API to check whether or not a specific password has been hacked before. Using this form is much safer then going to the "Have I Been Pwned" website, as all data is stored locally (instead of on a server) and, using a method known as k-anonymity, only the first 5 characters of the hash code are read (it is possible to dicipher a full hash code, however, it is near impossible to only crack a password with the first 5 characters).
